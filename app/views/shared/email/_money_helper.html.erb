  What’s MoneyHelper?
</h2>

<%= p do %>
  MoneyHelper is a government backed organisation that provides free and
  impartial guidance on your money and pensions. Our service is designed to
  support you in making your own informed decisions based on your circumstances.

<%= p do %>
  We don’t give legal or regulated financial advice or recommend specific
  financial products because we aren’t regulated or authorised by the Financial
  Conduct Authority to do so. This means we can’t tell you what the best option
  is for you, or what to do with your money or pension. If you’re looking for
  personalised money or pensions advice or specific product recommendations,
  you’ll need to see a regulated financial adviser or seek legal advice.
