How to prepare for your appointment

<% if @appointment.pension_wise? %>
You’ll usually benefit more from a Pension Wise appointment if you:

1. Ask each pension provider:
  * how much your pension is currently worth
  * if your pension has any special features, like a guaranteed pot value or annuity rate.
2. Check your State Pension forecast:
  * online at GOV.UK
  * by calling 0800 731 0175 between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday.
3. Have details of your other finances, like:
  * savings and investments
  * debts and repayments.
4. Think about your plan for retirement, such as:
  * when you’d like to stop working
  * what type of pension income you’d like.

During the appointment, you’ll be asked for details of the pension transfer you’re making and your financial circumstances.

It’s helpful if you can find out:

1. The type of pension you already have – usually defined contribution or defined benefit – and the name of the product, like a personal or workplace pension.
2. The type and name of the pension scheme you want to transfer to.
3. The fees and charges for both schemes.
4. How both schemes plan to invest your money, including the funds or types of asset they use – you can ask each pension provider if you’re not sure.
5. If your existing pension provider will tell you why your transfer has been delayed.

It’s also useful to:

* have information about all the sources of retirement income you might have, including other pensions
* think about your plans for retirement, including when you want to start taking your pension and when you’d like to stop working or reduce your hours.
