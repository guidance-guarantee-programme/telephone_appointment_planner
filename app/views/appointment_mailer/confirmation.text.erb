  Preparing for your appointment

To make your appointment as useful as possible, it would be helpful to know the following information:

  - the value of your pension pot(s) - check your pension paperwork or ask your provider
  - an estimate of your State Pension - call the Future Pension Centre on 0345 600 4274 for a State Pension statement
  - any special arrangements attached to your pension pot, eg a guaranteed annuity rate or a guaranteed pot value at a certain time - ask your provider

Think about your financial circumstances in general and plans for retirement, eg:

- sources of income like salary, benefits, savings, investments
- debts and repayments you might have
- when you want to stop working
- if you want a fixed or flexible income in retirement
