  Pension Wise is a government backed service which offers free and impartial
  guidance about your defined contribution pension options. We donâ€™t recommend

  A third party has asked to book a Pension Wise appointment to discuss your
  pension payment options. We need your authority to deliver a Pension Wise
  appointment to them on your behalf.

  Please complete the third party consent form and follow the return
  instructions:
